# Pelican (PLN) Online Ordering

#### Also known as PLN

Pelican (PLN) is a simple Open Source Online Ordering and eCommerce solution. It is built of people and organizations that want to manage a mid sized online presence. It leverages the best in payment processing Stripe and Braintree. It is a reality, you could be setup, configured and running within 30 minutes. All you need is a Stripe account.


### What is Pelican (PLN) if you are a business owner

PLN is a simple Online Ordering, eCommerce and essentially a CMS project rolled into one. It allows you to manage online customers, products and orders. Pelican also "links" to [Seal (BDO) CRM](https://github.com/mcroteau/seal), a customer relationship management tool which allows you to manage prospects, customers and clients. You can be up and running within minutes with minimal configuration version.


### What is Pelican (PLN) if you are a developer

PLN is a J2EE project, it is:

* Spring
* Hibernate
* Gradle
* Sitemesh
* Groovy


The framework used to develop the project is called Grails, Grails is a Java framework. Grails is unique in that it can be considered a productivity tool instead of a framework. A light tool that sits on top of J2EE project structure where Groovy is leveraged and when deployed becomes a J2EE project.

Grails is domain driven, leverages Groovy which is an abstraction of Java (you can write Java code within a Groovy class file), object oriented and in summary is a productivity tool. Attempt to write the same logic in any other technology stack of choice without missing out on Java's greatest assets and you're talking years of development instead of months. Customizations are quick as well. Everything, Models, Views and Controllers are nicely configured/glued together to create one seemless development experience.

https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781590599952 is a little dated, but gives a great run down of MVC (Model View Controller setup), Grails and why it is important. Not very many assumptions are made on how much you know, you will be starting from scratch with this book.

Pelican deploys to an Java application server of choice or can be run locally in an embedded container
You can use many of the RDBM systems out there (Postgres, MySQL) and have been configured to work with Mongo and others.


### What is our goal if you are a developer

We are local to the United States but understand the income disparity between certain areas of the World. Thats why we wrote Pelican (PLN) and Seal (BDO). We would like to create a product suite that can be used in other parts with as little as possible configuration changes. So you if you are local to another part of the World and would like to use and promote the project elsewhere, we could use translation support and maybe help in development. Feel free to fork at will.
